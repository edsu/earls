earls is a hack to display urls that are being tweeted with a given hashtag.
it uses node and redis to watch Twitter for new tweets with urls. The idea
is that it can help share information about what is being tweeted about
at conferences.

In theory earls could be reusable, especially since it is so plain looking. 
If earls was not created in such a hurry it would probably be easier 
to understand. Your help/ideas are welcome :)
